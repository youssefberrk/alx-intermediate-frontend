# CSS Preprocessors: SASS/SCSS for Efficient Styling

## Project Overview

This project is focused on learning and implementing **SASS/SCSS** as a CSS preprocessor for efficient styling. By utilizing Sass features like variables, mixins, and nesting, you will improve the way CSS is written and organized for more maintainable and scalable stylesheets. 

### Objective
The goal of this project is to install and set up SASS, practice using Sass variables, nesting, mixins, and debugging output, and apply them to real-world scenarios.

## Tasks

### 0. Project Set up
**Objective:** Install and set up SASS

**Instructions:**
1. Inside the `alx-intermediate-frontend` repository, create a new directory called `0x03-sass_scss`.
2. For Linux (Ubuntu) installation:
   - Install Node version 20.16:
     ```bash
     $ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
     ```
   - Exit and reopen the terminal.
   - Install SASS by running:
     ```bash
     npm install sass -v 3.7.4
     ```

3. Create a file called `0-installation-script` and document the steps you took to install SASS.

**Repository:**  
- GitHub repository: `alx-intermediate-frontend`  
- Directory: `0x03-sass_scss`  
- File: `0-installation-script`

### 1. Creating a Sass File to Output Debug Message 'Hello World'
**Objective:** Write a Sass file that prints `Hello world` in the debug output.

**Instructions:**
- Use the `@debug` directive to output the message in the debug log.

```scss
@debug "Hello world";
```

**Expected Output:**
```bash
$ sass 0-debug_log.scss | head -n 0
0-debug_log.scss:2 DEBUG: Hello world
```

**Repository:**  
- GitHub repository: `alx-intermediate-frontend`  
- Directory: `0x03-sass_scss`  
- File: `0-debug_log.scss`

---

### 2. Using Sass Variables to Assign Text Color to Body and Paragraph Tags
**Objective:** Assign the text color `#3D3D3D` to the `body` and `p` HTML tags using a Sass variable.

**Instructions:**
- Define a Sass variable `$text-color` and apply it to `body` and `p` tags.

```scss
$text-color: #3D3D3D;

body {
  color: $text-color;
}

p {
  color: $text-color;
}
```

**Expected Output (CSS):**
```css
body {
  color: #3D3D3D;
}

p {
  color: #3D3D3D;
}
```

**Repository:**  
- GitHub repository: `alx-intermediate-frontend`  
- Directory: `0x03-sass_scss`  
- File: `1-color_variable.scss`

---

### 3. Nesting
**Objective:** Use nested declarations to apply styles.

**Instructions:**
- Set no margin or padding on `body`.
- Apply margin `10px` to all `p` tags inside `body`.

```scss
body {
  margin: 0px;
  padding: 0px;

  p {
    margin: 10px;
  }
}
```

**Expected Output (CSS):**
```css
body {
  margin: 0px;
  padding: 0px;
}

body p {
  margin: 10px;
}
```

**Repository:**  
- GitHub repository: `alx-intermediate-frontend`  
- Directory: `0x03-sass_scss`  
- File: `2-nested_tag.scss`

---

### 4. Margin Mixins
**Objective:** Use a mixin to assign margins to `body` and `div` tags.

**Instructions:**
- Create a mixin called `set-margins` and apply it to `body` and `div`.

```scss
@mixin set-margins($left, $right) {
  margin-left: $left;
  margin-right: $right;
}

body {
  @include set-margins(10px, 10px);
}

div {
  @include set-margins(15px, 15px);
}
```

**Expected Output (CSS):**
```css
body {
  margin-left: 10px;
  margin-right: 10px;
}

div {
  margin-left: 15px;
  margin-right: 15px;
}
```

**Repository:**  
- GitHub repository: `alx-intermediate-frontend`  
- Directory: `0x03-sass_scss`  
- File: `3-mixin_margins.scss`

### 5. Manual Review
Once you have completed the tasks, request a manual QA review. The auto review will be launched at the deadline.

## Conclusion

This project helps you get hands-on experience with **SASS/SCSS** by setting up a local environment, using variables, mixins, nesting, and debugging. Completing this project will sharpen your CSS skills and prepare you to work with more efficient stylesheets in larger projects.
